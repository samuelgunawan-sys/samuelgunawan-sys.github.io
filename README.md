This is a website created by _intiq._  named "Random Word Generator". This website will generate a random word based on the parameters you set for it and may double as a word preview (as you can set fonts and if the length of word is equal to the length of word variable inputted, the 'the word is too long' thing will cancel out). This website is more of a proof of concept that stuff life this is possible to be made.
