This is a website created by _intiq._  named "Random Word Generator". This website will generate a random word based on the parameters you set for it and may double as a word preview (as you can set fonts and if the length of word is equal to the length of word variable inputted, the 'the word is too long' thing will cancel out). This website is more of a proof of concept that I am able to do things like this. Because of that, feel free to open up the code and use it for your own use.

To see the website that I made, simply open [this website](https://samuelgunawan-sys.github.io/). The only thing you need to set up is the word length as all the other ones are already pre-set. Go down the "Font Selector" drop-down and choose a font that you like, choose the type of word you want generated, and you can make a sort of password using the "Able to consist" of checklist buttons.
